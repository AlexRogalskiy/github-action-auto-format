# Short description of this project
description: |-
  Github Action Auto-format runs several repository "hygeine"-related tasks:
  - It adds all of Cloud Posse's standard repository files to a repo, if they're missing. This includes all of our standard Github Actions workflows and several other files that assist in maintaining the repo, such as [CODEOWNERS](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/about-code-owners).
  - It formats all terraform files in the repo, if needed, by running `terraform fmt` on the repository's files.
  - And it updates the repo's `README.md` file, by rebuilding it using `README.yaml` as a template and processing it with our README builder.

  If any of these operations lead to changes in the code, a new commit will be added to the pull request that triggered this action. 

  It is possible to run just the README functionality, separately from everything else, depending on the chosen value of the `script-name` input.

# How to use this project
usage: |-
  Copy the `.github/workflows/auto-format.yml` file from this repository into the `.github/workflows` folder of the repository to which you'd like to add Auto-format functionality.
  This will cause Auto-format functionality to execute on pull requests.
  This is an exhaustive list of all valid `script-name`s:
    - `terraform`
    - `readme`

# Example usage
#examples: |-
#  Here are some real world examples:
#  - [`github-authorized-keys`](https://github.com/cloudposse/github-authorized-keys/) - A Golang project that leverages `docker/%`, `go/%`, `travis/%` targets
#  - [`charts`](https://github.com/cloudposse/charts/) - A collection of Helm Charts that leverages `docker/%` and `helm/%` targets
#  - [`bastion`](https://github.com/cloudposse/bastion/) - A docker image that leverages `docker/%` and `bash/lint` targets
#  - [`terraform-null-label`](https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-null-label/) - A terraform module that leverages `terraform/%` targets

# How to get started quickly
#quickstart: |-
#  Here's how to get started...
#  1. `git clone https://github.com/cloudposse/build-harness.git` to pull down the repository
